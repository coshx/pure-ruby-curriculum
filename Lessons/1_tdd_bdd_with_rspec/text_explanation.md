####Lesson 1: TDD/BDD with RSpec

- Goal: Get up and running with the RSpec behavior-driven testing framework.
- Topics: Ruby gems, "Test-first development", the pry interactive debugger, accessing the filesystem, Ruby's blocks, deciding what to test, fundamental Ruby data structures
- Exercise: While writing tests first, we will create a program that generates a histogram of the number of instances of each character in an input file.
- Time: 3 hours

### Instructions:
- Download the files in 1_tdd_bdd_with_rspec
- Open that folder in your terminal
- Discuss gems with Gabe :)
- Install rspec gem (gem install 'rspec')
- Install pry gem (gem install 'pry')
- Create histogram_spec.rb and begin to write tests to create a histogram of characters based on a string input (see 1st link below)
- Write histogram.rb and create Histogram class
- Run test, does it fail?
- Make test pass, using pry while you write method
